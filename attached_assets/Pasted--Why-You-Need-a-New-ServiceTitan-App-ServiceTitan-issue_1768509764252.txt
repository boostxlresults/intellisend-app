✅ Why You Need a New ServiceTitan App

ServiceTitan issues:

Client ID

Client Secret

OAuth scopes

Environment access

👉 Per app, not per tenant
👉 Per environment (Sandbox vs Production)

So IntelliSend must be its own app — not reused, not shared, not hacked around.

🧭 Step-by-Step: Create the Correct ServiceTitan App
1️⃣ Go to the Developer Portal

👉 https://developer.servicetitan.io

Log in using an email that:

Has Admin access to the tenant

Is approved for Developer Portal access

2️⃣ Create a New App

Click:

My Apps → Create App

App Name (Best Practice)

Use something explicit and permanent:

IntelliSend SMS Booking Integration


This name will appear internally at ServiceTitan.

3️⃣ Choose App Type (IMPORTANT)

Select:

OAuth 2.0 – Server-to-Server

Why?

You are not acting on behalf of a logged-in ServiceTitan user

You are creating bookings programmatically

This avoids user consent prompts

This is the correct model for Twilio / automation platforms

🚫 Do not choose Authorization Code flow unless a CSR is logging in via your UI.

4️⃣ Configure OAuth Settings
Redirect URI

Even for server-to-server, ServiceTitan requires one.

Use something stable:

https://yourdomain.com/oauth/servicetitan/callback


(You won’t actually use it, but it must exist.)

5️⃣ Assign REQUIRED Scopes

At minimum, check:

✅ Bookings

bookings:write

✅ Customers

customers:read

Recommended (strongly):

jobs:read

appointments:read

calls:read

📌 Missing scopes = silent failures later.

6️⃣ Save App & Copy Credentials

After saving, you’ll see:

Client ID

Client Secret

👉 These go directly into your IntelliSend settings screen.

⚠️ Store these encrypted.
⚠️ Never expose them client-side.

7️⃣ Confirm Environment
Sandbox App

API Base URL:

https://api-integration.servicetitan.io

Production App

API Base URL:

https://api.servicetitan.io


🚨 You cannot reuse credentials across environments.

You’ll eventually have:

1 Sandbox App

1 Production App

This is normal.

🧠 Architectural Best Practices (This Is Where You’re Ahead)

Because IntelliSend is multi-tenant, you should:

✔️ Use one ServiceTitan app per environment
✔️ Store Tenant ID per IntelliSend tenant
✔️ Store OAuth tokens per tenant
✔️ Allow tenants to connect/disconnect independently
✔️ Never hard-code tenant credentials

You are building this correctly.

🧪 What I Recommend You Do Immediately After App Creation

Paste credentials into your UI

Click “Save Configuration”

Run:

OAuth token exchange

One test booking

Confirm booking shows as:

Source: IntelliSend-SMS
